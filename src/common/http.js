Generic entry point for HTTP requests.
It returns a Promise.
It queues and resolves a redraw request.

When resolved successfully, the response will contain:

* `body`{Object||String} It the request was for JSON data, it will be returned as an object, otherwise, the plain XHR `responseText`.
* `statusCode` {Number} Values in the 2xx range will be considered successful, others, a rejection
* `method` {String} The HTTP method that had been requested
* `headers` {Object} The XHR response headers
* `url` {String} The URL requested
* `rawRequest` {XMLHttpRequest} The XHR object for this request

The promise can be rejected with a standard JavaScript `Error` object with at least `name` and `message` properties if the request could not be processed due to erroneous arguments.  If the response comes with an error code above the 2xx range, it will also be rejected with the same response object as a successful response.
